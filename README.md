## Using the Component

### Services

The component provides the following services:

- `picture_frame_controller.next_image`: Show the next random unseen image
- `picture_frame_controller.previous_image`: Show the previously shown image
- `picture_frame_controller.set_album_filter`: Filter by album
  - Parameters: `album_name` (string)
- `picture_frame_controller.clear_album_filter`: Clear album filter
- `picture_frame_controller.set_time_range`: Filter by date range
  - Parameters: `start_year`, `start_month`, `end_year`, `end_month` (integers)
- `picture_frame_controller.clear_time_range`: Clear date range filter
- `picture_frame_controller.reset_seen_status`: Reset seen status for all media
- `picture_frame_controller.scan_media`: Re-scan media directories

### Lovelace Card

To add the picture frame controller card to your dashboard:

1. Edit your dashboard
2. Click "+ ADD CARD"
3. Scroll to the bottom and select "Custom: Picture Frame Card"
4. Configure the card:
   ```yaml
   type: custom:picture-frame-card
   entity: sensor.selected_image
   ```

## Album Organization

For best results, organize your albums with a date-based naming structure:

- Format: `YYYY-MM-AlbumName` or `YYYY_MM_AlbumName`
- Examples:
  - `2023-12-Christmas`
  - `2020_06_Vacation`

This allows the component to extract date information for time-based filtering.

## Sensors

The component creates the following sensors:

- `sensor.selected_image`: The current image being displayed
- `sensor.total_images`: Total count of media files
- `sensor.unseen_images`: Count of unseen media files

## Automation Examples

### Auto-start image display on Home Assistant startup

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Start Picture Frame on Startup"
    trigger:
      - platform: homeassistant
        event: start
    action:
      - service: picture_frame_controller.next_image
```

### Create a scheduled display

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Show Pictures in the Evening"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "18:00:00"
    action:
      - service: picture_frame_controller.set_time_range
        data:
          start_year: 2020
          start_month: 1
          end_year: 2023
          end_month: 12
      - service: picture_frame_controller.next_image
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No images found**: Ensure your media paths are correct and readable by Home Assistant
- **Incorrect album dates**: Verify your folder naming follows the YYYY-MM-Name format
- **Card not displaying**: Check that the custom card is correctly loaded
